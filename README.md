# Abstract
The aim of this thesis was to present the use of mobile technologies and the Google Firebase platform on the example of a service intermediary portal. It was supposed to facilitate ordering by customers and offering them by contractors. The created solution allows customers to add orders, which are then sent to matching contractors, who can submit their offers. Due to the two roles occurring in the domain under consideration, it was decided to create also two mobile applications. One of them is intended for service recipients and the other for service providers. They have a chat feature for communication and a rating and commenting system to help customers make the right choices. They also provide support for offline work and adaptation of the interface to tablet screens. The Firebase platform has greatly facilitated the implementation of the above elements, but its limited flexibility has been noted.
